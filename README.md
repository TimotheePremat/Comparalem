# Comparalem
R script to autodetect lemma with graphical variation.

> This is a alpha version of Comparalem V2. Developping of v2 is not finished yet, this is not intended for public use. Yet, it is fonctional; if you wish to use it, you're free to do so.

# Documentation
Documentation writing is undergoing. Some information is provided in ```Instructions.md```, but this is hardly a documentation. Scripts are interactive and ask the user for the input files and parameters.

1. Run ```MASTER_pre-tratment_R_form_SRC.R``` on your input files (with all forms of all lemma) to create dictionnaries of alternating lemmas
2. Run ```MASTER_R_form_distrib_txt_SRC.R``` on your input files (with all or part of all forms and lemma) to process lemma-alternation, statistical computation and map generation.

# Input files
The core difficulty of documenting this programm is documenting the format of input files. The script is delivered with a example dataset. Until full documentation is provided, make your input files look like the sample ones.
